Create a Japanese manga cover-style illustration based on the reference image. The composition should feature the main character prominently in the center, with a dynamic pose and expressive facial features. Include a manga-style title logo at the top, and add background elements that complement the story's atmosphere. Use bold, clean line art with vibrant colors typical of Japanese manga covers.
