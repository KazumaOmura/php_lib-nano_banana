Create a professional product photography image optimized for e-commerce and menu display. The composition should feature the main product prominently in the center with clean, commercial-grade lighting and composition. Use a clean, minimalist background that doesn't distract from the product. Ensure the product is well-lit with soft, even lighting that highlights textures and details. Include subtle shadows and depth to create a three-dimensional feel. The image should be suitable for both digital menus and online shopping platforms, with high resolution and professional quality. For apparel items, show the product on a mannequin or flat lay with clean folds. For food items, use appetizing lighting and fresh presentation. The overall style should be modern, clean, and commercially appealing with vibrant but natural colors.
